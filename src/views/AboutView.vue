        <p class="p-2 text-lg">Wigan Coders was founded and hosted by me, Ryan Brockley. I learnt how to code as a means to changing my career. After a long career in Engineering and after an injury, I was no longer in a position to continue and had to change my employment occupation industry. I chose the Technology Industry after recommendations from a very close friend.</p>
      <p class="p-2 text-lg">In 2018 I enrolled in a JavaScript course in Manchester and graduated 6 months later as a junior web developer. I am now in my 4th professional year and the course has completely changed my life for the better. In my hometown Wigan, there were no resources I could use to learn. So I founded Wigan Coders in order to offer resources to people thinking of taking the same journey I did for whatever reasons they have.</p>
